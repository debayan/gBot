gBot

21st January, 2010

You must have Qt4 devel packages installed. You should also have DBus and qdbus installed.

To build the project follow these steps:

1) Type qmake-qt4 -project
2) Type qmake-qt4
3) Type make
4) ./bot -c configFile.ini

You have your bot up and running. It listens at the DBus interface specified in configFile.ini.
Change the parameters there as you see fit.

Now, copy post-commit.sh to .git/hooks/post-commit of your git repository. Change the DBus interface
string there to reflect the one set in configFile.ini.
